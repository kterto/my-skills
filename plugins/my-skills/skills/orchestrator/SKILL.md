name: orchestrator
description: Multi-role pipeline orchestrator. Use when the user invokes "/orchestrator", says "orchestrate", or asks to "run the full pipeline". Auto-detects whether to run bootstrap (first-time setup) or go straight to the pipeline based on the presence of `.orchestrator/config.json`; pass `--setup` to force bootstrap. Spawns each role (brainstormer → architect → coder → tester → reviewer → qa) as a subagent via `subagent_type`. Never commits or pushes.

# orchestrator

This skill runs in the caller session and has the `Agent` tool. It spawns each pipeline role via `subagent_type`. It is project-agnostic — no project facts are hard-coded.

## Lifecycle — auto-detect

On invocation with a plain-language task description (and optional `--setup`):

1. Resolve config (see `references/config.md`): CLI args > `.orchestrator/config.json` > defaults.
2. If `--setup` is present OR `.orchestrator/config.json` does not exist → run **Bootstrap** (Steps B1–B3), then continue.
3. Run **Pipeline** (Steps 0–6).
4. On `READY_TO_COMMIT` → run **Spec eval + report** (Step 7).
